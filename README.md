## Summary
An exercise for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home). This is one of the first projects that I made that required a frontend and backend. It is also [project 8](https://anthonyargel.com/blog/#/blog/608cdebff3022700154f8f1f) of the [24 main projects](https://anthonyargel.com/blog/#/blog/6087a2dafedb56001512312d) I am aiming to write about in 2021.

## Implementation
This project uses Node, Express, and MongoDB (mongoose).

The frontend can be found [here](https://github.com/anthony-argel/blog)

## Thoughts
As of right now, this is my 2nd favorite creation of all time (The first being a poorly made [3rd person dungeon crawler RPG](https://anthonyargel.com/blog/#/blog/6087ad62fedb560015123130)). The reason why I love these two projects so much is that they're a culmination of my knowledge as a web developer and C++ programmer. A blog is such a simple thing that can be constantly upgraded with new information. So, as I continue to learn, I can continue to upgrade the blog.
